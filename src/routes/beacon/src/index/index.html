                Avalanche beacons can often be the deciding factor between life and death in the event of an avalanche.
                Although proven to work, the overall efficiency of avalanche beacons has remained stagnant over the past
                several decades.  Our goal as a team is to improve the efficiency of the avalanche beacon so that the
                process of finding a buried victim is much faster than its current state.  Many strategies and
                approaches are currently being researched by our team in order to find out how exactly this goal can be
                accomplished.  Some of our most promising approaches involve implementing a beacon with data that can
                be sent through radio waves, implementing an ad-hoc wireless network, and algorithms to calculate the
                final position of the victim based trajectory from the slide.  Nevertheless,  one of our team’s main
                priorities is to retain backwards compatibility in order to operate in unison with any beacon.

                <p class="justify-text">Modern avalanche beacons (transceivers) operate at a 457kHz frequency.  All beacons have two modes
                    in which they operate.  Those two modes are transmit and receive.  When a beacon is operating in
                    transmit mode, the beacon emits a low-power pulse.  When in receive mode, beacons will be able to
                    pick up the pulse emitted from a different beacon operating in transmit mode.  Whenever a beacon
                    detects a signal, the beacon will point the user in the direction that the signal was transmitted
                    from.
                    <br><br>
                    Some modern beacons have been implemented with technologies such as vitals detection.  This allows
                    users to determine whether a victim buried under the snow is alive or deceased.  This gives the
                    user the ability to continue searching for other buried victims instead of consuming valuable time
                    unburying a deceased victim.  Though this technology can be extremely useful in a lot of cases, it
                    doesn’t improve the overall time in which it takes to find a buried victim.
